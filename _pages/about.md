I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at UNC Chapel Hill. I started my PhD program and joined the <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup/" target="_blank">IDEA Lab</a> working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QGdnthwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Pew-Thian Yap</a> in 2017. Currently, I am working on MR reconstruction, signal representation, noise removal, and microstructure imaging for diffusion MRI data with the application in early age neurodevelopment. I am also collaborating with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=soMcNA8AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Ye Wu</a> developing the <a href="https://www.comedi.io/home" target="_blank">Computational Medical Imaging Toolkit</a>.

I received my Bachelor degree in Biomedical Engineering at International University, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. During my undergrad time, I worked with Dr. Loan Vo in designing MR compatible hardwares, designing experiments and acquiring data from studies' participants, and analyzing resting-state and task-based functional MRI.

**Fields of interest:**
- MR Physics and MR signal reconstruction/representation
- Diffusion MRI microstructure model
- Noise mapping and removal
- Neurodevelopment
- Functional and structural connectivity

**Academic services:**
- Journal reviewers: NeuroImage, PLoS ONE, IEEE-TMI, IEEE-TCDS.
- Conference/workshop reviewers: MICCAI, ISMRM, OHBM, MLMI.
