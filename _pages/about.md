I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at UNC Chapel Hill. I started my PhD program and joined the <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup/" target="_blank">IDEA Lab</a> working with Dr. Pew-Thian Yap in 2017. Currently, I am working on MR reconstruction, signal representation, noise removal, and microstructure imaging for diffusion MRI data with the application in early age neurodevelopment. I am also collaborating with Dr. Ye Wu developing the <a href="https://www.comedi.io/home" target="_blank">Computational Medical Imaging Toolkit</a>.

I received my Bachelor degree in Biomedical Engineering at International University, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. During my undergrad time, I worked with Dr. Loan Vo in designing MR compatible hardwares, designing experiments and acquiring data from studies' participants, and analyzing resting-state and task-based functional MRI.
